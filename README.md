# elise-typescript-demo
This is a simple getting started example for using the Elise Graphics Library
with TypeScript and Browserify. It is assumed Browserify is installed globally.
This can be done using NPM.

```
    npm install -g browserify
```
To build the example:
```
    npm install
    npm run build
```
This will launch the TypeScript compiler and Browserify to create a bundle.js in the
root folder. The main index.html file can then be launched in a web browser.
